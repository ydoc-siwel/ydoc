  <h2><center>“Truth will ultimately prevail where pains are taken to bring it to light.” – George Washington</center></h2><br>
  <br>
    <center><b>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their<br> Creator with certain 
                unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.   
    </b></center>
  <div class="article", align="justify">
    <p>
      "That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Consent of the Governed, 
      that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive to these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or abolish it, and to institute 
      new Government, laying its Foundation on such Principles[,] and organizing its Powers in such Form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their 
      Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient Causes; and 
      accordingly all Experience hath shewn, that Mankind are more disposed to suffer, while Evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing 
      the Forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long Train of Abuses and Usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a Design to reduce 
      them under absolute Despotism, it is their Right, it is their Duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security."<br>
      <br>
      --Such has been the patient sufferance of these citizens; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their Former Systems of Government. 
      The history of the legislative, executive, and judicial Powers is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an 
      absolute Tyranny over these states. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid World.

      They have abused and usurped the English language and the teachings thereof to the general public.<br>
      <br>
      They have unduly influenced the general public, over decades, by reinterpreting and redining the words, terms, and phrases as well as the context of the founding documents,<br>
      which has effectively reversed the indentities of the People and the Government, thereby altering the checks and balances doctrine to relate to credit and debt and have delegated<br>
      Powers to branches not vested therewith, thus altering or abolishing seperation of Powers and intituting the doctrine of equal protections under the law.<br>
      <br>
      They have passed laws which infringe upon unalienable Rights,
